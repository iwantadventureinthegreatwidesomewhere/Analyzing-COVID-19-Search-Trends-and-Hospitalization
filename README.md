##### Task1.ipynb must be ran cell by cell.  By running all at once, a cell has an issue withe above cells occuring too fast.  Make sure there are no warnings in task 1 before moving on to part 2.

##### Task3.ipynb will take up to 5 minutes to run completely.  Please be aware

Task1.ipynb will import googlesearchraw.csv,  hospitalizationraw.csv and will output mergedDataset.csv

Task2.ipynb will import mergedDataset.csv and will output plots within the notebook itself.

Task3.ipynb will import mergedDataset.csv and will output 14 matrices.  1 + 6 matrices for costs throughout symptoms for regression trees and 1 + 6 matrices for costs throughout symptoms for KNNs.  The matrices are available in folder "ONLY_FOR_REFERENCE" if needed.  If indeed needed, copy files from "ONLY_FOR_REFERENCE" into parent folder.

Task4.ipynb will import mergedDataset.csv and the 14 matrices created by Task3.ipynb. This is a special task where all of the results from task 3 are visualised in order to help understanding the costs. It will output plots within the notebook itself.
